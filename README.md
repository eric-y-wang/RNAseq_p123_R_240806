### Goal
* Characterize lentivirus transcriptomic effects on CD4 T cells in depth.
* Compare viral cytokine signaling vs recombinant signaling.

### Summary
Niave CD4 T cells from 3x 12W old F Foxp3-RFP mice were harvested and activated in-vitro for 24h. Cells were spinoculated with IL4, IL6, IL12, or linker only virus on the p123 background. Cells were also treated with recombinant IL4, IL6, IL12, or untreated. Cells were incubated x 24h and harvested for bulk RNA-seq using the BRB-seq kit from Alithea genomics.
